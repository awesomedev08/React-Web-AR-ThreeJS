## Documentation

You can find the detailed documentation [here](./docs).

## Todo

- [ ] AR Renderer for threejs - This will be done when AR.js stabilizes its API. Currently, everything is jumbled up!
- [ ] Component for creating portals - Using `aframe` primitive.
- [ ] Write tests - ??
- [ ] Add more examples
- [x] Cleanup

**Note** - This is still an experimental project and it also relies on [AR.js]() which is also being developed actively. I'll share a roadmap soon covering every detail. I'll recommend not to use this project in production because it's still not graduated from the experimental stage and requires a lot of internal work to go from experimental to stable. But, mostly importantly you can play with this project and can try to explore the augmented reality domain. I am sure that you'll enjoy this stuff. Thanks!
