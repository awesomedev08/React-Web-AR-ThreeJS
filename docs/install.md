# Install

* Place these two files in your `index.html` ( AR.js is packaged in an old manner ðŸ˜… ).

```html
<script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.7.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://rawgit.com/jeromeetienne/ar.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar.js"></script>
```

* Install `React-AR`

```
npm install react-web-ar
```

* Install `three.js` to create and render 3D objects. Also, `ReactArToolKit` component relies on `three.js` internally so make sure you've installed it.

```
npm install three
```
