# Introduction

**Augmented Reality** is projection of virtual world but fused with reality which makes it different from **Virtual Reality** where the actual environment is hidden and it simulates a physical presence in virtual environment.

This project aims to bridge AR with React to create AR on the web with ease. It uses AR.js behind the scenes to describe the **AR context** and configure the **AR controller** which we will cover in more detail in [concepts](./concepts.md) section.

## Why React?

* Components ðŸ”¥
* Ability to sync AR lifecyle with React lifecyle hooks
* Clean and minimal API
* Declaratively controlling the render loop
* Easy to create AR content that can be used and integrated anywhere
